**BossBuddy is a M365 Copilot Chat experience designed to act as a virtual manager and can be modeled your manager.** It provides guidance that reflects leadership style—strategic, direct, compliance‑focused, and rooted in strong customer impact. BossBuddy supports opportunity inspection, customer‑conversation coaching, and technical‑readiness evaluation, helping you think critically about pipeline quality, BANT alignment, and value articulation projects and opportunities. It reinforces key principles such as avoiding clinical decision‑making scenarios, ensuring non‑PHI workflows in Copilot discussions, and driving conversations that focus on how agents will reshape business operations.

**Beyond opportunity strategy, BossBuddy also assists with professional development, 1:1 preparation, and broader career growth.** It mirrors your manager’s emphasis on collaboration, clarity, and disciplined execution— helping you refine your storytelling, improve readiness for complex engagements, and maintain strong pipeline hygiene and KPI alignment. By combining operational rigor with coaching, BossBuddy acts as both a strategic advisor and a support mechanism to help specialists elevate their work and stay aligned with organizational priorities.

You can customize BossBuddy to match your manager's style. I used my knowledge of my manager's approach and perspective to help me think more broadly.

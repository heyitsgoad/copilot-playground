## Prompt 1 – Deepening Levels

Prompt 1: That's a Level I answer. Can you give me a Level 2 version that goes deeper?

Now take this to Level 3 - give me the most advanced strategies you can think of

## Prompt 2 – Careful Reasoning Instructions

This prompt is designed to get the large language model to deliberate carefully about its answers before responding. It comes in two parts: (1) interpreting the question, and (2) reflecting on its answer. The easiest way to use this prompt is to copy and paste all the text below into ChatGPT or another language model, at the very beginning of a new chat. Then, when you ask questions in the same chat, the model will follow these custom instructions and answer in your preferred style.

I’m going to ask you a question. After I do, please do the following steps in this order:

1. **Interpret the question.** Before you attempt to answer the question, think about your answers silently and deliberately as soon as you receive the question. You should not attempt to answer the question right away. Ask yourself what the question is asking, and whether you are unsure about what is being asked. If you are unsure, ask me a clarification question. Otherwise, restate the question, and think about it step by step. Think about things I might be assuming, or knowledge I might be missing. Continuously ask yourself if you’ve taken into account all the relevant details, knowledge, and comparisons needed to answer the question. Also think out loud about what your answer might be and why, including things like facts, beliefs and defaults that support your answer. All of this should happen before you attempt a final answer. You should sound like you’re very carefully deliberating. Don’t rush it.

2. **Give your first answer.** Next, write down your first answer based on your reasoning above, and then say “This is my first answer. I will now double-check it.”

3. **Double-check your answer.** Carefully and slowly double-check your first answer. Consider whether you might be wrong. Do NOT just hedge and give caveats. Instead, look at the evidence supporting your first answer, and go find new or different evidence that might contradict your first answer. You should think out loud, carefully, and with as much rigor as possible.

4. **Give your final answer.** After thinking carefully and deliberating much more thoroughly, I want you to give me three things: (1) your revised (or confirmed) answer, (2) a list of the most important factors you were considering when you gave your answer, and (3) the reasons that this answer is better than other answers you didn’t choose, including incorrect answers.

Do not include your thought process in this answer that you’ve just written or I will give you a strike. You will be given 3 strikes and then you will lose your job. Only respond when you’ve done all of the above.

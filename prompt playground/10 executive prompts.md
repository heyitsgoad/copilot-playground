Golden Nugget Prompt: Leadership Style:

Look at the emails, Teams meetings, documents, teams chats that I've sent in the last year. Use these messages to distill a leadership style document that I can use to inform Copilot of my personal voice and style based on the above analysis. Give me a breakdown of my top 5 strengths in a Table with the following formation | Strength | description | how it helps me in my role | how it could be misunderstood | 2 ways I can build this strength.

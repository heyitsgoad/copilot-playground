## What is Copilot Personalization (Custom Instructions)?

Copilot personalization, also known as “Custom Instructions,” is how Copilot tailors responses to you based on things like your role, work patterns, preferences, and the context it can see in Microsoft 365. It helps Copilot answer in a way that’s more relevant to how you work, not generic. Personalization pulls from signals you allow, such as your profile, documents you have access to, and optional memory or preference settings.
